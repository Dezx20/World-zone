## TO RUN THE PROJECT

### First clone or download the repository

- Now go to the downloaded directory (simply open that directory in the terminal)
- run **npm install** cmd
- after successfully install all the dependencies, which is done in the earlier command
- If u run into some error while installing dependencies use **yarn install** instead of npm.
- Since you are in this step i believe dependencies are successfully installed. So, now you can simply type **npm start** cmd and this will start our project on localhost:3000
- If by change u used yarn to install the dependencies you can type **yarn start** to start the same.
- By default while running localhost:3000 port will open automatically in your default browser incase this doesn't happen simply type this url in the browser: **localhost:3000**
- Starting the project may take time to load in the browser so please be patient.
